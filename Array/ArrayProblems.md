# Contains Duplicate

##	 Problem 1:

### Problem Desription:

Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears more than once in the array, otherwise return false.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 3]

Output: true

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]

Output: false

## Problem 2:

### Problem Desription:

Given two strings s and t, return true if the two strings are anagrams of each other, otherwise return false.

An anagram is a string that contains the exact same characters as another string, but the order of the characters can be different.

Example 1:

Input: s = "racecar", t = "carrace"

Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "jar", t = "jam"

Output: false

Constraints:

s and t consist of lowercase English letters.

## Problem 3:

## Problem Description:

Two Sum

Solved 

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return the indices i and j such that nums[i] + nums[j] == target and i != j.

You may assume that every input has exactly one pair of indices i and j that satisfy the condition.

Return the answer with the smaller index first.

Example 1:

Input:
 
nums = [3,4,5,6], target = 7

Output: [0,1]

Explanation: nums[0] + nums[1] == 7, so we return [0, 1].

Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,5,6], target = 10

Output: [0,2]

Example 3:

Input: nums = [5,5], target = 10

Output: [0,1]

### Solution :

I have used a hashmap to track the index of elements . 

Time complexity `O(n)` space complexity `O(n)`
